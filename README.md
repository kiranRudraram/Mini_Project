Typing speed Increaser Game using Python

In this project, we present the detailed development and implementation of simple 
Speed Typing game. The Speed typing game consists of Graphical user interface. We
 implemented this Speed Typing game by using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter module. Tkinter is
 the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a
 fast and easy way to create GUI applications. This project helps you to improve your
 Typing speed i.e the player/user can improve their typing speed playing this game.
 This game usually takes input from user and compares that with predefined words.
 Once the game starts, one-by-one random word will pop-up on your screen and
 player has to type each word in the given amounts of seconds i.e 60s to score. Other-
wise you will lose the game and to play again, you just have to click on play again. This
 project gives an insight in to the different aspects of python programming and
 practical knowledge of Tkinter modules and classes. This software is easy to use for
 both beginners and advanced users.
